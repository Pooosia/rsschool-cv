### **About myself**

 After graduating from Minsk State Linguistic University I worked in logistics area for 2 years. Now it's my 4th year in digital agency as a SEO specialist and marketologist. Between that time I worked in a call-center, as a freelance copywriter, as a promoter and as an English teacher. Now I decided to try something new and entered the RS School

============================================================================

 Telling the truth, I don't have any experience in programming, but when I started learning HTML and SSL I faced no difficulties in its understanding. So I hope that by the end of the course I could tell that I gained certain skills. Here's my first experience: [My CV](https://Pooosia.github.io/rsschool-cv/cv "My CV")
